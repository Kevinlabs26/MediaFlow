## Privacy Policy

**Last Updated: August 2026**

**We respect your privacy. Here is exactly what we track and what stays on your device:**

### 1. Data Collection

We do **NOT** collect logs of what media you archive or process. Media processing (download, transcribe, enhance, subtitles, etc.) happens **locally on your machine**.

**Local data on your device may include:**

* **Settings** (download path, language, theme, concurrency, clipboard options) via Electron `electron-store`
* **Local logs** under the app user-data folder (for troubleshooting). You can open this folder from **Settings → Privacy → Open logs folder**, and clear temp/cache/logs from Settings
* **Temporary files** created during processing (cleaned on exit / manual cleanup)

**Optional clipboard link detection (off by default):**

* When you enable it in **Settings → Privacy**, MediaFlow may read clipboard text **only on your PC** to detect capturable media URLs
* Detection uses local URL rules; **clipboard content is not uploaded**
* Matching links show a **system notification**; the app opens and fills a URL **only after you click** the notification
* You can choose detection range (strict / balanced / loose) or turn the feature off at any time

**Optional local network features (not auto-started by default):**

* **Mobile / LAN helper** and **browser extension helper** may listen on **localhost / local network** only when you enable them
* PIN protection may apply for MobileFlow; traffic is for device-to-device transfer on your network, not to MediaFlow cloud media storage

**Optional error reporting (user toggle):**

* If you enable “Send error reports”, **anonymized crash/error diagnostics** may be sent to our optional telemetry endpoint (e.g. Google Apps Script). This is **disabled or no-op** when not configured. We do not intentionally include your media files or download URLs in those reports

### 2. Third-Party Services

* **yt-dlp / ffmpeg / local AI tools**: May contact target media platforms or use local binaries you install; MediaFlow does not proxy your media library to our servers for normal archive workflows
* **Auto-update**: Official builds may check a release CDN (e.g. R2/generic publish URL) for newer installers
